The Benelux Algorithm Programming Contest, or BAPC for short, is a programming contest in which teams of leading universities from The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxemburg compete in solving algorithmic programming problems. The goal of every team is solving as many problems within a certain time and resource limit. These problems have to be programmed out and are then checked by an automatic system for correctness. Each of the universities organize their own preliminaries, and the teams that solve the most problems on the actual BAPC can continue to the NWERC, the contest between all kbo s in North-West Europe. The teams that perform the best on the NWERC can continue to the ICPC, better known as the world finals.

This year, the BAPC is organized by [**Cover**](https://svcover.nl/), the study association for Artificial Intelligence and Computing Science of the University of Groningen.
