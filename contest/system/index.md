This page describes current plans for the Programming Environment which will be available to each BAPC 2024 team.

Each team will be provided with one laptop, shared between team members. Each laptop will have an external mouse. The configuration of each laptop will be as follows:

## Hardware

## Languages

The following languages are allowed during the contest:

- C
  - Standard: gnu17
- C++
  - Standard: gnu++20
- Python
  - Version: Python 3.10
- Java
  - Version: 17
- Kotlin
  - Version: 1.9

Note that Python 2 is no longer supported.

## Compilation of Submissions

During the contest, teams will submit proposed solutions to the contest problems to the Judges using the [DOMjudge](https://www.domjudge.org/) contest control system. This can be done through the [web interface](https://www.domjudge.org/docs/manual/8.1/team.html#web-interface), or using the [submit client](https://www.domjudge.org/docs/manual/8.1/team.html#command-line-submit). Source files submitted to the Judges will be compiled using the following command line arguments for the respective language:

- C:

  - gcc -std=gnu17 -x c -Wall -O2 -static -pipe -o $1 "$1.c" -lm
  - Available as mygcc

- C++:

  - g++ -std=gnu++20 -x c++ -Wall -O2 -static -pipe -o $1 "$1.cpp" -lm
  - Available as mygpp

- Python 3:

  - pypy3 $@
  - Available as mypython

- Java:

  - javac -encoding UTF-8 -sourcepath . -d . $@
  - Available as myjavac

- Kotlin:
  - kotlinc -d . $@
  - Available as mykotlinc

## Execution of Submissions

For each language, if the above compilation step is successful then the submission will be executed as follows:

- For C/C++: the executable file generated by the compiler will be executed to generate the output of the submission.
- For Python 3: the main source file will be executed by the PyPy3 Python3 interpreter to generate the output of the submission.
- For Java: the compiled main class will be executed using the following command:
  - java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -XX:+UseSerialGC -Xss65536k -Xms1966080k -Xmx1966080k $@
  - Available as myjava
- For Kotlin: the compiled main class will be executed using the following command:
  - kotlin -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -J-XX:+UseSerialGC -J-Xss65536k -J-Xms1966080k -J-Xmx1966080k $@
  - Available as mykotlin

Compilation and execution as described above will take place in a "sandbox" on a dedicated judging machine. The judging machine will be identical to the machines used by teams (see [Hardware](#hardware)).

The sandbox will allocate 2 GiB of memory; the entire program, including its runtime environment, must execute within this memory limit. For interpreted languages (Python, Java, and Kotlin) the runtime environment includes the interpreter (that is, the PyPy3 interpreter for Python and the JVM for Java/Kotlin). The sandbox memory allocation size will be the same for all languages and all contest problems. For Java and Kotlin, the above commands show the stack size and heap size settings that will be used when the program is run in the sandbox.
