# The contest

The Benelux Algorithm Programming Contest (BAPC) is a contest in which teams from leading universities in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg are served a series of algorithmic problems/puzzles. The goal of each team is to solve the most puzzles as possible within the set time limit. Solutions need to be programmed out on a computer and can be submitted to an automated judging system, after which the solution is checked.

The teams that have solved the most puzzles at the end of the contest qualify for the [Northwestern European Regional Contest](https://2024.nwerc.eu/). In this regional competition the teams can qualify themselves for a ticket to the [International Collegiate Programming Contest](https://icpc.global/), also known as the World Finals.

The BAPC 2024 is hosted by the University of Groningen, and organized by a committee of study association Cover.
