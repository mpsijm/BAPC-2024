## Directions

See more details [here](https://arc.net/l/quote/zoezlszr).

### Directions by public transport

When you have arrived at the main station of Groningen, take busline 15 to Zernike. Get off at the stop Nijenborgh. You will see a large blue building. This is the Bernoulliborg.

For people arriving by train from Leeuwarden, sometimes it is faster to get to Zuidhorn by train and then take the bus to Groningen. This bus also stops at the Nijenborgh stop.

### Directions by bike

To bike from Groningen city center to the Zernike Campus you go via the Prinsesseweg, which will become the Zonnelaan. Arriving at the Zernike Campus, continue straight ahead until you reach Zernikeplein. On the east side is a large blue building. This is the Bernoulliborg.
